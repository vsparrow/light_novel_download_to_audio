# light_novel_download_to_audio

This bash script will download a light novel from a fan translator and convert the text into audiobook format

MacOS is required due to the use of the "say" command. 

An alternative in linux would be "festival" or "espeak" but the MacOS voices are far batter. This should be usuable on lnux by changing say to a linux voice interpretor since its using bash and I built the initial iteration on linux 

MacOS built in "say" option is the superior choice

Another alternative would be to use the Google Speech api or AWS Polly but those cost $$ after a character limit
